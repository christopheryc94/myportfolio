                <p>My name is Christopher Clark and I am 24 years young. I am a fairly new programmer but am loving every
                    minute of it so far! A few years ago I took my first programming class at the University of Arizona learning
                    java and a bit of C++. I unfortunately did not continue with computer science until I saw a python course
                    being offered online for free. Once I learned some python I found the UofA coding bootcamp and decided
                    to give this field another shot, not realizing it was going over javascript. I gave it a chance though
                    and immediately fell in love with this new found language and completed this 24-week bootcamp. I am now
                    on the hunt for a job while I continue to program for fun, trying to better myself and grow as a programmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I said before, I am looking for my FIRST programming job but when given the chance I will give it my all. I will bring
                    enthusiasm, a strong work ethic, and a desire to better the company I work for.
                </p>
